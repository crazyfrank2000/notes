Briefing:
Before i take the CQF challenge, review the study technique is very important and helpful


## 20 hours to learn everything

1. deconstruct the skills 
2. learn enough to self-correct 
3. remove practice barrier, like phone, procasination
4. practice at least 20 hours

>
you need to deconstruct the skills or the topics into small pieces and practice them one by one , each at a time.
>
then you need to know how to correct the wrong part of your study and edit it to the correct version. You need to know what you are doing wrong and when.
>
remove anything that distract you from study your content , including phones, people, and social media.
>
practice the skills at least 20 hours.

It’s better to **record every activities by timer**, to summarize how you spend your time at each actions.

## SY: The most important part for study is **Debug**

1. Debugging 
2. Feyman techniques 

> Debugging 
is to figure out what is the missing part of your knowledge ?
>
what is the exactly missing piece preventing you from answering the question?
pinpoint it 

Feymen technique 
> is very useful for find the missing piece
take a white paper 
write the explanation use your own languages, or use analogy, diagrams , examples to help the understanding , as if you are teaching someone else
explain why and how , when you’re struggled ,go back to your materials and revisit it.
fill in that gap as the missing part.


## SY: How to read a **text book**, with 2 step

1. Depth of processing
2. Recoginizing what’s important for a textbook

> The real learning is to process the information with depth level
To highlight the text on books is superficial and very shadow 
You need to write your own handnotes for each chapter
- brief points of what is it
- new theory: jog it down and give it and example
- the purpose of note is to promote a deep level of processing, not to have a **perfect copy of the book**

what is important for a textbook?
> 1. the problem solving 
2. the method for solving that problem


## SY: How to learn Really Hard Subjects

Method 0. Prepare the groundwork,Framework and fundaiton

Method 1. Recursively deepen your understanding of the topics, **Feymen Technique** ,Teach the topic to yourself-> Build those knowledge deeper intuition 

Method 2. Provide a context for what you’re learning:
prepare question, with Q&A, you can quickly correct yourself

>
At first, 80% of time to practice M1 as you are learning new things
then you need more practice for the question under context.

## SY:How to learn Math Faster
- MIT challenge example, math the video of 30hours within two days with 1.5x
- normally the math class will have two parts,

>
1) techniques for math doing , moving the figure and rules of doing it.
2)**intuition** behind it

- 1st of all, find a good teacher or someone who can explain it for you
- 2nd, you have to walk through that intuition in your head
> math is to describe something as being a certain  relationship, which you can applied to everywhere

## SY:Ultra Learning: A strategy for learning is self-directed and aggressive
- les1 the hard way is the easy way; with imersion learning languages
- les2 A litter fear is helpful
- les3 Feedback is important, ignore most of it
> the real problem is to transfer the text book knowledge into usage
- Timer for very activity

## SY Rapid Learner
### MIT Challenge Example
- watch lectures at 1.5x-2x the speed with vlc player
- practice triage(鉴别分类）
> foucs on the hardest problem first, rather than even coverage. check solutions after each problem to gain feedback faster.

- use feymen techniques

> to break down difficult concept quickly

###Key Point for MIT courses in 5 days
1. Cover
2. Debug
3. Insight

> first cover the materials, download it and play it with 1.5X
then find out what you don’t know with quesiton and solutions and a rapid feedback is helpful
tips: you can try to use sample exersie, to cover as much topic as possible
with short questions , you can figure out what’s wrong or the missing pieces very quickly.
At last, you can always use feymen techniques to think through the ideas , and pinpoint the specific pieces that you don’t understand.
Tips, with a wide range background materials , you can have other explanation 

### 30-days portrait drawing challenge Example
- skill decompostion
> broke down the skills into components, such as position facial features, and practice rapidly via doing quick sketch

- tight,accurate feedback
> take photos of my sketches and overlay the ref photos to see exactly what mistakes I was making.

- meta learning

### 7 Learning Principle
1. Design your project well
2. Train focus and productivity
3. learn actively
4. quicker,deeper,more accurate feedback cycle
5. space your practice out
6. process deeply to retain more
7. over learning

Design your project well
> 1. pick your constraints carefully  设定边际，不要求多
2. set aside enough time
3. limit your materials and methods

Train focus and productivity
>
1. eliminate distraction
2. create productivity system -> schedule your time and work carefully. if you dont plan your day, you will always be playing catching up
3. progressively train your focus

Active learning : learn->practice->re-learn
> Reading books , attending lectures, reading assignments is passive learning. You need to learn in a most active ways as possible.
**It means practing the knowledge directly by using it in real problem**, answer the question or using the skills

Quick Feedback cycles
>
1. Do the cycle more quickly
2. do the cycle more deeply
3. get more accurate feedback 

instead of waiting for the whole project is finished, you need to figure out the gap at each question.  **the faster feedback the faster learning**

**I often do two types of feedback cycles**:
long and deep plus quick and shallow

Spacing is very important for comprehend the knowldege
>
spacing out your practice results is much stronger and more memories than bunching it in one spot

**Do Frequent Review Testing on Material** after you learned
**Adding more practice over time** after you first learn

Deep learning:
>
paraphrasing （解释，释义）your notes , not to write them down verbatim
summarize , not to highlight while reading

## SY Programming Tips and Learning
experience is the best way to program more quickly
for python learning , you can use google python class
[google code](https://code.google.com)
- within 3 days or 4 days to finish 6 assignments
- you can get the materials print out and markup
- do mini projects


## LJT: 学习方法论

1. Have a whole picture of the content with xmind, outline, etc
2. Fey men technique
3. Active recall
4. frequent revisit

### 复习笔记如何做

- 复习笔记：如自己写一本全新教材的形式，从零开始
- 上完课后，自己复习做的笔记
- 2-3H，复习大的章节
- 按每个小节作为一个单位，不断重复
- 在理解透这个小节以后，才开始做笔记
- 不要看着教材写笔记，将自己理解的内容，以一种自己在写一本简易教材的形式，将知识点写进笔记本
- 不同颜色的笔，记录不同的内容
- 你在思考，理解的过程，才是做这个笔记的关键
- 错误笔记：理科刷题
- 关键点，将其写进笔记
- 不停复习
- 可以将其记录在复习笔记最后
- 准备cheatsheet与公式表
